# exp2b2_HelloArrayList
Example Java project created via STS as Java Project, to show case collections' List<T> (ArrayList<T>), showing;
- collections' generic ArrayList<T> is a concrete implementation of collections' List<T> interface.
- so, declare variables' type as List<T>, but let them point(get initialized) to ArrayList<T> instance
- List<T> declarations
- initialization of List<T> variables with ArrayList<T>
- we do not need to set a size (like we do with arrays). Its size is dynamic.
- declaration and initialization together
- filling up ArrayList instances
- default toString() of ArrayList takes care of converting it to String properly. Hence printing it is easy
- "add"
- "add" at a specific index
- "contains"
- "indexOf"
- "get"	at an index
- "size"
- for each loop over the List<T>
- "addAll" to add all elements of another List<T>
- converting an array to ArrayList using Arrays.asList
- "remove" a specific element
- "remove" at an index
- "clear"
